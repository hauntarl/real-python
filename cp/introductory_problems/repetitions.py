    You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, 
    and T. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is 
    a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.

    The only input line contains a string of n characters.
    Print one integer, the length of the longest repetition.

    Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

    Example
    Input: ATTCGGGA
    Output: 3
