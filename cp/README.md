# Competitive Programming

The CSES [Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/text/2433) is a collection of algorithmic programming problems. This repository contains solutions in Python for mentioned problem set.

If you are new to competitive programming and need a thorough introduction to the basic concepts, terminologies and algorithms. Refer [Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) by *Antti Laaksonen*. It is a free online book which goes hand in hand with the CSES Problem Set.

All the benchmarking results are generated using [PyPy - Python Interpreter](https://realpython.com/pypy-faster-python/). To see an example, refer *fibonacci*.py.
